# Common Characters

Write code which will return the common characters found in two different strings.

## Notes:

- You should only need to return the characters once.
- Spaces should not be included
- Ignore letter case
- The order of characters in the resulting string should follow the order of characters in `string1`

## Examples:

- `commonCharacters("efg", "feg") // returns "efg"`
- `commonCharacters("We are both dragon energy", "I am God's vessel") // returns "eaodg"`
- `commonCharacters("Alright alright alright", "") // returns ""`
