**Teaching Resource:** repo containing all discused Ed challenge results.

## `pnpm` Package dependencies

**NOTE: The following steps are only required for running the tests/contributing.**
To run locally `npm` or just running the unit tests with `jest` _should_ be fine.

- This project uses `pnpm` for managing node packages
- Use `npm i -g pnpm` to install this globally.
- Run: `pnpm i` to install package
- Testing `pnpm test`: runs all tests

### Pre-commit/formatting

- `pip install pre-commit`
- `pre-commit install`

## Setup/structure

Each directory contains my submission as discussed/shown in class. A description (from `Ed`) of the challenge is also present within each directory. The unit tests that your code should satisfy have also been included.
